Bad:
I am going to list out the bad i found in the Minesweeper game design.


I list out class wise.

Game:
=======

Observation #1
-----------------
Game is creating Cell,Board, Mine.

Opinion:
Game should have a person to create them and give it to him. For instance. Game can have a Preparer do this setting up job.


Observation #2
-----------------
the method get_User_Val(BufferedReader) is public. 

Opinion:
The above method can be private since it is only called by self.
Also BufferedReader is passed to the method. It can access a instance variable directly instead of every time passing the reference to it.


Cell:
=======

Observation #1
-----------------
Cell , the name itself has a mistake.

Opinion:
Cell contains an 2D array of integer. in real cell should have only one value at any point of time. so the class name should be Cells.

Observation #2
-----------------
fill_Cells(). this method name is not correct.

Opinion:
fill_cells() message on Cells is reiterating the same thing. It can be just fill()


Observation #3
-----------------
The below methods are public
check_Mine_If_Not_Place_One(int row,int col,int total_mines)
count_Adjacent_Mines(int row,int col)
set_Local_Mines_Count(int row,int col)
set_Mine_Count(int row,int col)

Opinion:
The above methods can be private since it is only called by self.


Observation #4
-----------------
return_Total_Mines() method name is not adhering Java naming convention.

Opinion:
getTotalMineCount() should be the name.

Observation #5
-----------------
test() method should not be mingled with the development code. 

Opinion:
it should be display the cells. so the method can be display()

Observation #6
-----------------
RowElements and ColElements is local variables

Opinion:
They can be instance Variables.

Observation #7
-----------------
Cells has extra responsiblity of calculating the value for each cell which should be encapsulated from it. 

Opinion:
There should be a separate class for holding the each cell values. It can be Cell.


RowElements / ColElements
=========================
Observation #1
-----------------
set_Rmin_Rmax(int row)
check_First_Row(int row)
check_Last_Row(int row)

These three methods are together doing only one functionality. Setting the boundaries i.e min and max of a row


Opinion:
only set_Rmin_Rmax(int row) method can be public. other two can be private logics

Observation #2
-----------------
RowElements term is not descriptive to that functionality. 


Opinion:
It can be renamed to NegihboursRowIteratorProperties


Mine
======
Observation #1
-----------------
Mine Checks for whether a particular cell is Mine. 

Opinion:
So it should be probably a MineChecker.

Observation #2
-----------------
System.exit(0) is used for termination of the game - it is used in class Mine (which is a Game class responsibility).

Opinion:
Mine should have a behaviour which return boolean on checking a cell for mine or not.


Common:
=======

1. Names of methods and member variables are not adhered to the java naming conventions.
